# Unreal-Driving-Light-from-Movement

A slightly wordy title - this is a project where a person was playing a cello in a mocap suit.

I used blueprints to drive colour and brightness changes in the sky - check out Sian_Blueprint_mod for full logic. The music tracks are also isolated to broadcast from each stone - you can either stay in the middle and hear the full track, or go closer to each stone to hear their stems.

This was built for a VR headset - thus when using PIE there's no movement logic. Best to use simulate for now and just move where you want.

This is what it look and sounds like: https://youtu.be/WC0fgE0CFwg
